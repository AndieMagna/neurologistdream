	      <h2>Morning Routine</h2>
	      <p>As a neurologist, my day needs to start early. I usually wake up around 6:00 a.m. and take a quick breakfast, after I fulfill some time by reviewing patient notes, recent scans, and different cases I've been assigned to. I put on my professional attire, which usually consists of a dress shirt, slacks, and my white coat. I arrive at the hospital by 7:30 a.m. I check in with the nurses and residents to review overnight updates on patients with neurological conditions such as strokes, epilepsy, or Parkinson's disease. My morning often starts with patient rounds, discussing symptoms, reviewing MRI results, and adjusting treatment schedules. The environment seems heavy in concentration, but having there moments of urgency, as every decision is made of any influence, and can affect an unpredictable amount in the human brain.</p>

	      <h2>Midday Tasks & Projects</h2>
	      <p>As a neurologist, my main duties involve diagnosing and treating disorders of the brain, spinal cord, and nervous system. I spend much of my day meeting with patients to evaluate symptoms like headaches, seizures, muscle weakness, or memory loss. I work closely with other healthcare professionals such as neurosurgeons, nurses, radiologists, and physical therapists to provide comprehensive care. My tools include neurological instruments like reflex hammers, tuning forks, and penlights, as well as advanced technologies such as MRI and CT scans to examine brain activity and structure. I also rely heavily on analytical thinking, communication, and problem-solving skills to interpret test results and explain complex conditions in ways patients can understand.</p>

	      <h2>A Story from Neurology</h2>
	      <p>"As a neurologist who has followed up countless Parkinson’s patients over the last 32 years of my fifty-year career; I denied diagnosing myself with Parkinson’s disease (PD), although the seldom mild involuntary “twitches” that occurred in the thumb of my right hand over a two-year period, resembled Parkinson’s disease tremor. However, when these involuntary contractions became persistent; considering its similarity to characteristic resting tremor in typical PD, the positive effect of dopaminergic medications, the development of levodopa-induced dyskinesias and other non-motor symptoms, it was clear that the PD diagnosis was accurate. This situation naturally caused me anxiety, and for a year and a half, I kept my diagnosis hidden from everyone except a few close relatives. However, with the encouragement of a psychiatrist friend, when I was able to share my condition with my loved ones, I felt a relative reduction in the burden I was carrying and consequently experienced emotional relief. I am still able to carry out my daily activities independently with a rather low dose of medication, and my PD symptoms do not attract noticeable attention." <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11165607">https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11165607</a></p>
